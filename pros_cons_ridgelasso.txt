Pros and Cons
Advantages
I Ridge regression can reduce the variance (with an increasing bias)
? works best in situations where the OLS estimates have high
variance
I Can improve predictive performance
I Works in situations where p < n
I Mathematically simple computations
Disadvantages
I Ridge regression is not able to shrink coefficients to exactly zero
I As a result, it cannot perform variable selection
? Alternative: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
